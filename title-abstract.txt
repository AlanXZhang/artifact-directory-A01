Title:
Improving App Launch Time with Deep Learning

Abstract:
Technology that advances the frontier of computing receives more attention than innovation in hardware optimization. Nevertheless, optimizing existing hardware is critical in minimizing global electronic waste by extending the lifespan of computers and making a modern computing experience accessible to more people. In this paper, we present a proposal to use neural networks to analyze system usage reports and determine the applications that are most important to the user. The network can be utilized to feed into a program that pre-emptively launches applications in the background, reducing wait time and enhancing the user experience. We will showcase the data that we previously gathered using the Intel XLSDK package, which we will use to train a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and a Long Short-Term Memory LSTM).
